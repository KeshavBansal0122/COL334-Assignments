# Quick Start Guide - Assignment 4

## 🚀 Fast Track to Completion

### Step 1: Verify Installation ✓

```bash
# Check Python
python3 --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Install dependencies
pip3 install matplotlib numpy pandas

# Verify Mininet (optional - for experiments)
sudo mn --version
```

### Step 2: Quick Local Tests (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/aryan/Desktop/2501-col334-assignment4

# Test Part 1 - Reliability
chmod +x test_part1.sh
./test_part1.sh

# Test Part 2 - Congestion Control

### Step 4: Write Reports

#### Part 1 Report (in `part1/part1.txt`):

```
PART 1: RELIABLE UDP FILE TRANSFER
===================================

1. PROTOCOL DESIGN
------------------
[Describe your implementation - about 0.5 pages]

Header Structure:
- Sequence Number (4 bytes): Byte-oriented sequence number
- Reserved (16 bytes): For future extensions
- Data (up to 1180 bytes): File data

Key Features:
- Sliding window protocol with configurable SWS
- Cumulative ACKs (TCP-style)
- Adaptive RTO: RTO = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT
- Fast retransmit on 3 duplicate ACKs
- Out-of-order packet buffering

2. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
-----------------------
[Insert your plots and analyze them - about 1.5 pages]

Figure 1: Download Time vs Packet Loss Rate
[Describe what you observe - e.g., "As loss increases from 1% to 5%, 
download time increases from X to Y seconds due to more retransmissions..."]

Figure 2: Download Time vs Delay Jitter  
[Describe observations - e.g., "Higher jitter leads to longer download 
times because RTO must be conservative to avoid spurious retransmissions..."]

Key Observations:
- [Your analysis here]
- [Any interesting patterns]
- [Performance characteristics]
```

#### Part 2 Report (in `part2/part2.txt`):

```
PART 2: CONGESTION CONTROL
===========================

1. ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION
------------------------
[Describe TCP Reno implementation - about 0.5 pages]

Implemented TCP Reno with:
- Slow Start: cwnd doubles per RTT (exponential growth)
- Congestion Avoidance: cwnd += MSS per RTT (linear growth)
- Fast Retransmit: Retransmit on 3 duplicate ACKs
- Fast Recovery: cwnd = ssthresh + 3*MSS
- Timeout: Reset to 1 MSS, ssthresh = cwnd/2

Initial Parameters:
- cwnd = 1 MSS (1180 bytes)
- ssthresh = 64 MSS
- MSS = 1180 bytes

2. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
-----------------------
[Insert plots and analyze - about 1.5 pages]

Experiment 1: Fixed Bandwidth (100-1000 Mbps)
Figure 1: Link Utilization and JFI vs Bandwidth
[Analysis: "Link utilization remains high (~90-95%) across all bandwidths,
demonstrating good scalability. JFI stays close to 1.0, showing fair 
bandwidth sharing between the two flows..."]

Experiment 2: Varying Loss (0-2%)
Figure 2: Link Utilization vs Loss Rate
[Analysis: "As loss increases, utilization decreases gradually. The
congestion control algorithm correctly reduces sending rate in response
to packet loss..."]

Experiment 3: Asymmetric Flows (RTT difference)
Figure 3: JFI vs Client2 Delay
[Analysis: "With increasing RTT asymmetry, fairness decreases slightly.
The flow with lower RTT gains advantage because it can react faster..."]

Experiment 4: Background UDP Traffic
Figure 4: Performance under UDP Traffic
[Analysis: "TCP flows maintain fairness among themselves even with
bursty UDP traffic. Link utilization varies with UDP load..."]
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Connection refused"
```bash
# Check if port is in use
netstat -tuln | grep 6555

# Kill any existing processes
pkill -f p1_server
pkill -f p2_server
```

### Issue: "Module not found"
```bash
pip3 install matplotlib numpy pandas
```

### Issue: Mininet experiments hang
```bash
# Clean up Mininet
sudo mn -c

# Restart Ryu controller
pkill -f ryu-manager
ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_13
```

### Issue: Permission denied on test scripts
```bash
chmod +x test_part1.sh test_part2.sh
```

## 📊 What Makes a Good Report?

### DO:
✓ Include clear plots with labels and legends
✓ Explain trends you observe in the data
✓ Connect results to theory (e.g., "TCP Reno reduces cwnd by half on loss")
✓ Use proper technical terminology
✓ Keep it concise (2 pages max per part)

### DON'T:
✗ Just describe what the code does (we can read it)
✗ Include code snippets (not needed)
✗ Make plots too small to read
✗ Forget confidence intervals (Part 1)
✗ Skip the analysis (plots alone aren't enough)

## 📚 Key Concepts to Mention

### Part 1:
- Sliding window protocol
- Cumulative ACKs vs Selective ACKs
- RTT estimation and RTO calculation
- Fast retransmit advantage over timeout
- Trade-off between reliability and performance

### Part 2:
- Slow start vs congestion avoidance
- AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease)
- Fast retransmit/recovery benefits
- Fairness vs efficiency trade-off
- Impact of RTT on fairness

## 🎓 Final Tips

1. **Run experiments overnight** if needed (they can take time)
2. **Save all CSV files** - you might need to re-generate plots
3. **Take screenshots** of successful runs as backup
4. **Write reports as you go** - easier than doing it all at once
5. **Test on different network conditions** to understand behavior
6. **Compare your results** with expected TCP Reno behavior
